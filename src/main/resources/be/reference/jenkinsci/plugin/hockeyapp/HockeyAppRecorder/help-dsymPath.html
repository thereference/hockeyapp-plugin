<div>
    The path of the dSYM ZIP file(s) to upload to testflight.

    If not specified, for each IPA file found, a related '-dSYM.zip' or '.dSYM.zip' file is searched for.
    If found it is added to the upload request as <i>dsym</i> parameter.

    Note: in the future this parameter will probably be removed and replaced with an optional argument to upload dSYM files or not.
