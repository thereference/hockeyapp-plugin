    The path of the file(s) to upload to testflight.

    Can use wildcards like 'module/dist/**/*.ipa'.
    If not specified the default pattern is '**/*.ipa, **/*.apk', i.e. will search recursively for any IPA and APK it finds.

    See <a href='http://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/fileset.html'>
    the @includes of Ant fileset</a> for the exact format.
    The base directory is <a href='ws/'>the workspace</a>.
